# Morse-Code-Translator-Tkinter-Project
Morse code translator, from scratch to the end.

This work based on personal home-fun projects from my electronics interest.

As a challenge myseIf, I choose an idea and drive it to develop to high level program.

This [link](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html), gives me idea about creating the desktop app with python for morse code translation.
Tkinter will be used in the project as GUI. Program will be similar or maybe better.

What you know about morse code? Here is an example for you. 

**ozgur is the best -> --- --.. --. ..- .-. / .. ... / - .... . / -... . ... -**

if you wonder about why you see "Ozgur is the best" in the image, you may like this story -> [“My First Line of Code”: Linux Creator Linus Torvalds](https://bit.ly/3kBbqLv)

Let's contribute it for fun.

Happy Coding! :grinning:
